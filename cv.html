            <h4> August 21, 2015 </h4>

            <h5> Dear Patreon, </h5>

            <p> One morning about a year ago, I found myself sipping a strong cup of coffee catching up on my daily
              RSS
              feeds. I came across an article detailing a new start up named Patreon, a write-up which left me both
              excited
              and, in a sense, relieved. The internet has always been a place funded and upheld by advertising, just
              as
              television before it. However, an unforeseen facet of this network is its ability to create a globally
              decentralized “Medici Family,” with websites like Patreon being its Florence. I believe that this
              style of
              funding will be essential in maintaining the diversity and democracy that the internet has brought to
              the art
              world. And so, I found my way to your jobs postings happy to see all of your smiling faces and bios
              and
              exhilarated by the list of open positions. After reading through the various descriptions, this is one
              of the
              positions for which I felt I would be a suitable candidate.</p>
            <p>I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, a field very closely connected to Computer Science. During
              the
              course of my degree, I worked hands on with various programming languages including Maple, Matlab and
              Latex.
              In addition, for the last 6
              months I have been focusing on more pervasive languages such as Python and HTML/CSS/JS using the
              abundance of
              sources on the internet as a guide while practicing with various personal projects to hone my skills.
              I
              believe that this type of
              background would allow me to serve as capable bridge between the users and the engineering team. My
              insight
              could be constructive in utilizing feedback effectively to help Patreon continue to improve.</p>
            <p> I was employed with my university's outreach program in which I would teach math concepts to
              promising
              S.T.E.M. students. The topics we covered, if treated incorrectly, could be dull and boring to a class
              of high
              schoolers, but this experience
              allowed me to learn how to verbally shroud these subjects in such a way that I could teach the kids
              without
              them even realizing! After my first year with high school students, I was then asked to help with
              larger
              freshman tutorial classes.
              Here my technical communication was put to the test, with one on one personal explanations. This
              experience
              helped my communication skills to further grow. </p>
            <p>So why did I wait a year to apply? At the beginning of my last year of University, my family's
              business
              caught on fire. We were faced with a year long absence which we feared could deteriorate our customer
              base.
              However, this event also gave
              us a rare chance to rejuvenate our business and return stronger than before. When I returned from
              school I
              spent the remaining 3 months working on the construction, and 6 months getting the business on it's
              feet,
              needing to learn entire systems
              and invent new solutions every step of the way. Being there for that experience showed me what really
              goes
              into starting a business from the ground up. I'm confident I would be able to channel this experience
              into my
              work at a start up like
              Patreon because I firmly believe in its goals. Thank you for your time and consideration, I look
              forward to
              hearing from you.</p>

            <p> Many of these duties I had to learn in a very short period of time. In times where I needed guidance
              I was
              able to effectively coordinate with various consultants as well as research quickly for solutions. In
              some
              cases it was also neccessary
              to develop systems which could be taught and then implemented later on by other employees. Through
              these
              experiences I have become a more dynamic learner, a more organized and priority driven worker, and an
              effective communicator.</p>

            <p> Serving in this position provided me with a great deal of learning experience in how to run an
              organization.
              Needing to keep updating everyone in the group and constantly trying to recruit new members meant that
              I had
              to be good at making the
              group feel as approachable and fun as possible. While the memebers were all great people, as an
              outsider or
              even as a new member the group can seem daunting without a welcoming central figure.
